### JavaScript-Game-Of-Set
Welcome to the Game Of Set! 
* This project implements the game of set through the use of JavaScript
* Pages are created using html to make a visual front-end for the players
* Styling and Formatting of the html pages are done through the use of CSS
* For more information, see BitByBits original implementation of the game in project 2



### Running The Program
* To run this program, simply run the html page labeled ```homepage.html``` in your local browser
* You will first be prompted to enter the number of players playing. The game also supports singleplayer so entering 1 is also allowed!
* Next you will be prompted to enter the names of each player.
* Finally the program takes you to the game board and you are ready to play!
* When you find a set, click your name on the left and then choose your cards.
* Players get +1 point for correctly identifying a set and -1 point for it being incorrect.


### Functionality
* Singleplayer and Multiplayer - Multiple players can play at the same time
* Names - Players can have their own player names to see their progress
* Scores - Keeps track of each player's score and displays all synchronously to keep track of the winner
* Animations - Created animations for showing card hints
* Hint Generator - Shows the player 2 of the 3 cards that can make a set
* Exit - Players are allowed to exit the game at any time

### Project Development
* One of the hardest parts of this project was learning JavaScript on the fly, and being able to implement the features that are in the game of set.
* Multiplayer was a challenge for the team members since making everything synchronous for each player took a lot of time.
* With more time, the team would have implemented more features, such as a race against time. Also, more testing could have been implemented to make sure all the functions are working. 

### Contributions
* Some of the bigger/complex areas of the game were developed together synchronously, which is why some branches don't have as many commits as others. 
* The development of the game was split in 3 between the homepage/styling, the logical elements of the game, and the event handling such as buttons and cards.
