                The deck consists of 81 unique cards that vary in four features with three possibilities 
                for each feature. Number of shapes (one, two, or three), shape (diamond, squiggle, oval), shading 
                (solid, striped, or open), and color (red, green, or purple). In the game, certain combinations of 
                three cards make up a set. So what defines a set? Of the three cards chosen, each category must be 
                all the same or all different. To clarify this, we can see an example. 3 solid red diamonds, 2 solid 
                green squiggles, and 1 solid purple oval forms a set because the numbers in each card are all different, 
                the shading in each card is all the same, the color in each card is all the same, and the shape in each 
                card is all different.</p>
